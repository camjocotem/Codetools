# Codetools

This is a website I built in order to assist me (and others) with some repetitive tasks at work


## SQL 'IN' parameter generator
This provides the ability to convert a line separated list (typically taken from excel) to a quote-and-comma separated list to be used in a SQL 'IN' statement

## SQL 'INSERT' parameter generator
This provides the ability to convert input taken from a csv file (or copied from an excel file) into the SQL 'INSERT' syntax

## List comparison page
Occasionally when comparing data and expecting both sources to contain the same results, I can use this to display all common and different values between the values used for each list.
